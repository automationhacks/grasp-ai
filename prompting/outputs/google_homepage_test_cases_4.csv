Test ID,Title,Preconditions,Steps,Expected Result
RT-BACK-01,Verify system behavior when the search API is unavailable,Backend API service is temporarily shut down,"1. Send a valid search request (e.g., 'OpenAI').
2. Observe the system response.","The system returns an appropriate error message (e.g., 'Service temporarily unavailable') with a 503 HTTP status code."
RT-BACK-02,Verify system behavior during high latency in API responses,"Introduce artificial delay (e.g., 5 seconds) in backend API responses","1. Send a valid search request (e.g., 'OpenAI').
2. Measure the time taken for the response.","The system handles the delay gracefully, displaying a loading indicator or retry mechanism without crashing."
RT-BACK-03,Verify system response when the database is inaccessible,Simulate a database connection failure in the backend,"1. Send a valid search request (e.g., 'OpenAI').
2. Observe the system response.",The system returns an appropriate error message and logs the database connection issue for further debugging.
RT-BACK-04,Verify search API response when dependent services fail,"Simulate failure in a dependent service (e.g., autocomplete or suggestion service)","1. Send a valid search request (e.g., 'OpenAI').
2. Observe the response for missing or degraded functionality.","The API returns search results without suggestions, with an appropriate warning or degraded service notice."
RT-BACK-05,Verify API stability under sudden high request volume,Backend API service is operational,"1. Simulate a surge of 10,000 requests per second to the API.
2. Monitor the system response and service stability.","The system handles the load gracefully, rejecting excessive requests with a 429 status code (Too Many Requests) while maintaining stability for other users."
RT-BACK-06,Verify API response for malformed requests,Backend API service is running,"1. Send a malformed search request (e.g., invalid JSON or missing required parameters).
2. Observe the system response.",The API returns a clear error message with a 400 HTTP status code (Bad Request) and logs the issue for analysis.
RT-BACK-07,Verify circuit breaker functionality during persistent failures,Simulate backend API failure for 10 consecutive requests,"1. Continuously send valid search requests while the API is down.
2. Observe when the circuit breaker is triggered.","The system halts requests temporarily and retries after a set time, ensuring minimal strain on the service."
