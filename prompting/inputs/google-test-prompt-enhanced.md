Generate test cases for the Google homepage. Cover the following areas: functional, non-functional, security, accessibility, performance, and usability. Test the web (desktop and tablet), mobile (responsive and native), and backend services.

The homepage includes:

- A search box with autocomplete.
- 'Google Search' and 'I'm Feeling Lucky' buttons.
- Voice search (mobile-specific).

Test input variations like valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases, and security attempts. Non-functional aspects should include performance (load time), accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance), and compatibility (across devices and networks).

Output the test cases in CSV format with columns: Test ID, Title, Preconditions, Steps, Expected Result. Provide at least 5 test cases per type of testing
